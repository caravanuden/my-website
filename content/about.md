![that's me!](/images/about/cara.jpg "that's me!")


I'm a machine learning engineer at Wayfair, where I work on competitor product matching at the terabytes of data scale. My team won the Wayfair Hackathon in 2019 with our [Clusterbrowse](http://caravanuden.com/wf_clusterbrowse/) project.

I graduated from Dartmouth College, where I studied Computer Science and Cognitive Science. My [thesis](/pdfs/about/thesis.pdf) compared representations learned by various CNN architectures to those of the human ventral visual pathway.

Check out my [resume](/pdfs/about/resume.pdf).
